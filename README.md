Next.js 15 with tailwindCSS
Integrated api's I created
There is issue in completed, incomplete and missing condition data is not storing so that's why condition is not working properly. I created and integrated api
It took 7 hours to complete all becuase of api creation. Because creating api in next js is new for me. Without api creation just integrating api this work is only 2 to 3 hours for me.
